## 2. Top Things to Do in Nusa Penida

### a. Kelingking Beach
The most famous viewpoint—nicknamed “T-Rex cliff.” The view from above is incredible, and the hike down to the beach is steep but rewarding.

### b. Diamond Beach & Atuh Beach
Two stunning beaches separated by dramatic cliffs. Diamond Beach is Instagram-famous with a long staircase down the cliffside.

### c. Angel’s Billabong & Broken Beach
A natural infinity pool and a circular rock formation with an ocean arch. Great for photos, but not safe for swimming.

### d. Crystal Bay
Perfect for sunsets and snorkeling with sea turtles and vibrant fish.

### e. Thousand Islands Viewpoint & Rumah Pohon (Treehouse)
Iconic photo spot with views over cliffside islets. Stay overnight at the treehouse for a unique experience.
